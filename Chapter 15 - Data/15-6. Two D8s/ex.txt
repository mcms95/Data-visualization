Create a simulation showing what happens when you roll two eight-sided dice 1,000 times. Try to picture what you think the visualization will look like before you run the simulation, then see if your intuition was correct. Gradually increase the number of rolls until you start to see the limits of your systemâ€™s capabilities.
