# Ex -> In the resources for this chapter, youâ€™ll find a file called world_fires_1_day.csv. This file contains information about fires burning in different locations around the globe, including the latitude, longitude, and brightness of each fire. Using the data-processing work from the first part of this chapter and the mapping work from this section, make a map that shows which parts of the world are affected by fires.
